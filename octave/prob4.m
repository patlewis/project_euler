Project Euler Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from 
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

The naive solution is simple: count down from 999 to find the largest palindrome
as a brute-force technique.

The faster solution is to first compute highest palindromes and them work down 
from there, as there are fewer palindromes than there are factors.  Once the 
palindrome is found, possible factors are explored.

I think.
