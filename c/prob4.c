/*
 * Project Euler Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product
 * 
 * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made 
 * fromthe product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 * Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 * 
 * The naive solution is simple: count down from 999 to find the largest 
 * palindrome as a brute-force technique.
 * 
 * The faster solution is to first compute highest palindromes and them work 
 * down from there, as there are fewer palindromes than there are factors.  Once
 * the palindrome is found, possible factors are explored.
